# FolderList [live demo](http://folderlist.kucharskov.pl) v3.1

### What is it?
FolderList is a simple script written in PHP to display and interact with the contents of a folder.

### What license?
FolderList is made available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. This means that you can use it where you want and how you want. Be sure to mention the author, though!

### How much does it cost?
FolderList, despite the fact that it does not contain ads, and the author does not make any profit from its development, the script is completely free!

### Functional!
Built-in icons, security system, multilingual are just some of the perks. Written in HTML5 and CSS3.<br>
The first versions ran even on Internet Explorer! Now I don't guarantee this archaism ;)

### Configurable!
Edit style or messages. Ability to disable display of selected files and folders.<br>
Configurable:
- `$FL_CONFIG["lang"]` - Script language (English, Polish, Russian).
- `$FL_CONFIG["heading"]`,  `$FL_CONFIG["subheading"]`, `$FL_CONFIG["sitename"]`, `$FL_CONFIG["sitedesc"]` - Header, subheader, page name and description (SEO)
- `$FL_CONFIG["showdir"]` - Display of folder path at the top
- `$FL_CONFIG["showtime"]` - Display of loading time
- `$FL_CONFIG["agebadge"]` - Configurable "NEW" label for new files since X days
- `$FL_CONFIG["hiddendirs"]` and `$FL_CONFIG["hiddenfiles"]` - Hiding selected folders and files

### Small in size!
Despite its rather extensive system and number of features, FolderList only fits in one file, containing settings, messages and even icons!
